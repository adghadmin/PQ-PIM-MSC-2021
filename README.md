This is a preview version of our group's paper *PQ-PIM: An Efficient Pruning-Quantization Joint Exploration Framework for Practical ReRAM-Based DNN Accelerator*ï¼Œ which has been accepted by **[MSC@ESWEEK 2021](https://msc-esweek.github.io/program.html)**. We design an efficient pruning-quantization joint exploration framework for practical ReRAM-based DNN accelerator, which consists of a patch-wise pruning-quantization algorithm and a configurable mixed OU-based single bit ReRAM DNN engine. The algorithm significantly compresses DNN models based on comprehensive patch importance analysis.
